The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, intends to maximize the number of annual members so as to ensure the company’s long-term financial growth. The pricing plans comprise single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships, with casual riders defined as those who use either single-ride or full-day passes.\nMoreno has decided to design marketing strategies focused on converting the casual riders into members. Therefore, she needs the analytics team to understand how usage patterns differ between the two groups. By analyzing historical ride data, the team will be able to uncover key trends to refine marketing strategies with the aim of achieving this goal."
